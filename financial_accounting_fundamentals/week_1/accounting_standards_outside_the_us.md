# Accounting Standards Outside The US

IFRS or International financial standards.

Some countries will have different standards for their countries. 
Some countries will also prepare their financial statements with U.S. GAAP to better entice the U.S. market to working with them.

There is extensive overlap between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

GAAP from country to country can vary considerably. 

The IASB lacks legal authority to impose standards on any country. 
It takes a collaborative effort. But the U.S. has not.
In 2008, the SEC developed a plan to adopt IFRS, but in 2012 the SEC voted not to.

Companies that use GAAP can use LIFO, or last in first out, while companies that use IFRS cannot.
Companies that use this method pay a lot lower income tax if they use that method.

The IASB and FASB continue to work together very closely to minimize the difference between the IRFS and U.S. GAAP.
