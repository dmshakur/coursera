# The Balance Sheet: A Summary

The balance sheet shows us the financial position of a company at a specific point in time. 
It is cumulative in nature so it shows us everything that has happened since the companies inception, to the point of time that the balance sheet was prepared.
A company can prepare one at any time, but they also **must** do so every quarter and every year, if they are a publicly traded company.

## Assets and liabilities
Fundamentally the assets have to exactly equal to the owners equity and liabilities combined.
$$
\texttt{assets}=\texttt{owner's equity}+\texttt{liabilities}
$$
Current assets will be converted to cash within a year, non-current assets otherwise.

Current liabilities will be paid within a year, non-current liabilities otherwise.
