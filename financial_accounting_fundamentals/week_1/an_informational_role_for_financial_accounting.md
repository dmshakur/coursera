# An Informational Role For Financial Accounting

Companies require a lot of money to run their business so they issue security to investors, who in turn invest money for the company to run their business. This is called the securities market.

THe companies create financial statements, and information about the financial position of the company to investors.

This information must have integrity, which is what **accounting standards** give us.
