# Assets

Assets are resources that provide future economic benefit.

When can a company record assets in the books.
* It must be controlled by the company as a result of a past exchange or transaction.
* Expected to provide future benefits that can be reliably measured.

Classified as current or non-current.
Current assets are ones that we would expect to use within a year, and non-current are everything else.

Common examples of assets:
* Cash
* Accounts receiveable.
* Inventory.
* Prepaid expenses.
* Investments.
* Property, plant, & equipment.
* Intangible assets.
  * Those that don't have much physical substance in nature like patents or brand names.

Historical cost is the original cost of the asset.

The standard setters have traded off relevance for reliability.

Conservatism; When we see a decline in value that we don't expect to see come back up for the forseeable future, we revert to a conservative approach.
