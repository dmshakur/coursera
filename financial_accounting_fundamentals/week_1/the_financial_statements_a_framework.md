# The Financial Statements: A Framework

At the beginning of a period we could have a balance sheet that would tell us what the company looks like at that point in time. 
Everything that has happened from the companies inception will be accumulated into the balance sheet.

When we look a financial statements we have two methods to help us understand how we got from one period to another.
* The income statement.
* The statement of cashflow
They help us understand what happens during a period of time.
