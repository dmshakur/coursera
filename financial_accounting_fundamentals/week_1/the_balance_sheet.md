# The Balance Sheet

The most important financial statement that a company can prepare.

Balance sheets are relatively similar to each other across different companies.

It shows the financial position a specific point in time.

It will list liabilities, assets and owners equity.
* Assets: Resources that are expected to provide future economic benfit.
  * Examples: Cash, inventory, buildings
* Liabilities: Where the company got the funds to invest in those resources.
  * Amount owed to suppliers.
  * Loans from the bank.
* Owners equity items: 
  * Capital stock.
  * Retained earnings.

At the end of the assets section they will be totaled to give an indication of the amount of resources the company owns.

At the end of the liabilities and owners equity section they will be totaled to give us an idea of the amount of liabilities and resources the company has obtained.

The asset section gives a us a peek into the investments that they make.

The liabilities and equity section of the balance sheet gives us a peek into the companies financing decisions.
Or how the company has chosen to finance how it invested in those resources.

The assets must equal the liabilities + owners equity, this is call the balance sheet equation.

As long as that relation holds true.
