# T-Accounts: A Tutorial

A t-account is a $\textrm{T}$, where the top above the horizontal cross has the account title.
The left side entry, or the **debit** account is on the left side of the vertical line, under the horizontal line.
The right side entry, or the **credit** account is on the right side of the vertical line, under the horizontal line.

For some accounts the left side entries are increases, and vice versa for the right side accounts.
This can differ between accounts.

#### The balance sheet equation
$\textrm{Assets}=\textrm{Liabilities }+\textrm{Owner's equity}$

Since assets are on the left side of the equation, we will record any increases on the left side and decreases on the right side of the $\textrm{T}$. Since liabilities and owner's equity are on the right side of the balance sheet equation we will put the increases on the right side of the $\textrm{T}$
