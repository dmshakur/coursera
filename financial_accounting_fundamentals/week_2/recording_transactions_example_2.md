# Recording Transactions: Example 2

This time the company will purchase $100 worth of inventory, and it does so on account, in other words it will pay for it at a later date.

1. The company gets inventory, the asset's inventory account is affected.
2. The inventory gets an increase of $100, but cash remains the same since the cost will be paid at a later date. So it now has a liability. Which will go on the accounts payable account.
3. This is an increase in liability and an increase in inventory.
4. $100 for both liability and inventory.
