# Journal Entries: A Tutorial

## There are four things you need to know to record a journal entry.
1. The accounts that are affected.
2. The type of account, either asset, liabilities, and owner's equity.
3. Whether the account decreases or increases.
4. The dollar amount.

## The format for writing a journal entry
Each journal entry has a debit side or left side and a credit side or right side.
The left side is written first. Then the right side is written underneath the left side, and indented slightly to the right.
```
Account name(Account type) (Increase or decrease) $Total (<- Left side)
    Account name(Account type) (Increase or decrease) $Total (<- Right side)
```
**The left side and the right side's total dollar amounts must be equal.**
