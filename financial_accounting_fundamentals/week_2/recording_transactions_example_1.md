# Recording Transactions: Example 1

Suppose a company buys $100 of inventory and pays with cash.

1. Asset account is affected, inventory is affected.
2. We are dealing with the asset account here.
3. There is an increase in inventory and a decrease in cash.
4. The amount is $100.


Increases in assets are debit entries. We want to record the debit entries first.
Decreases in cash are recorded as credits or on the right side. Which we will record last.

## Journal entry: Example 1
$$
\begin{matrix}
\textrm{Inventory(A[sset account])} 
& \textrm{(inc[rease])100} \\\\

\textrm{Cash(A)}
& \textrm{(dec[rease])100}
\end{matrix}
$$

The balance sheet equation is the ultimate truth in accounting and must remain in balance.
